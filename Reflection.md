This lab was the most difficult of by far but a good learning experience being able to test concepts and learn how to work with classes. 
I spent 5 hrs + trying to figure out how to make a pointer array of class objects which at that time felt awful. I had problem 
understanding  ‘overloading’ and didn’t really understand how to implement it in the code. With that said I learned a lot from this 
lab about how classes work but in my opinion it may have been too many concepts to work on 
for one lab. As getting a good understanding of each concept i crucial to get a good base to build on.


I spent about 17 hrs on this lab
